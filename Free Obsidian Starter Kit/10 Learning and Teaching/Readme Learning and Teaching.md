## 🎓 10 Learning and Teaching – Track Your Growth

We’re always learning. Whether you're enrolled in a course or explaining something to a friend - you're learning and teaching every day.

This folder is your **personal growth log**. Use it to track:
- Academic learning
- Soft/hard skill development
- Any informal teaching or knowledge-sharing moments

## 📘 `11 Study`

- A space for your formal academic journey — lectures, course notes, assignments, research.
- I created and refined all my PhD class notes here. Everything stays connected across semesters.
- **Avoid overusing folders.** They create silos and mental friction. Let links do the organizing.

> 🧠 Your first-year notes might solve a final-year problem - only if they're connected.

## 🛠️ `13 Skills`

Track personal and professional skill-building:
- Cooking, coding, fishing, design, writing — everything counts.
- I don’t mind folders for distinct skills like `PowerPoint` vs `Fishing`, since context differs.

For better clarity:
- Create a [[MOC Hard Skills]] for technical skills.
- Create a [[MOC Soft Skills]] for interpersonal, language, or creative ones.

## 📦 `19 Misc`

- Not sure where a note fits? Drop it here temporarily.
- Review it later and move if needed.
- It still contributes to your learning vault.

## 🧭 Pro Tips

- Every folder should ideally have a `MOC` (Map of Content) to keep navigation fluid.
- Use tags like `#learning`, `#teaching`, or `#skills` for traceability across the vault.
- Teaching notes? Record them here - tutorials, slides, workshops, even your own explanations to others.
