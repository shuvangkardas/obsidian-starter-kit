## 📚 80 Knowledge Library – Capture What You Learn

We consume a **massive amount of information** daily — from books, podcasts, YouTube videos, academic papers, blogs, even social media.

But here's the catch:  
🧠 **We forget what we don't capture.**

...only to forget where it came from months later?

This folder solves that.
