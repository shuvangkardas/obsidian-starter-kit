start recording my meeting and this is very good way. Okay, if you do not see record button in your meeting node, you will go code plugin and then enable from here. That is really cool.

And this is good way to identify the nuance of any problems or any discussion. Or if you want to identify the something which is kind of not easy to remember, you can actually go back to recording and identify that. But the good thing about this is at the end of this video, I will show you how you can use this recording and use AI to identify the all actionable items and any details you need to know about this discussion.

So essentially, you will be able to speak to your boss, maybe in future. This is good point, right? Listening carefully. So I know this is difficult.

I just write down the important details, important points. But for the integrity details, I record the meeting with permission. So for example, my boss provided me to record the meeting.

So then I go ahead with record button over here. It's start recording. Just for the demonstration purpose, since I'm recording for last few minutes, let me actually stop the recording and show you what it recorded.

Okay, for the demonstration purpose, I'm recording this for last few minutes. And let me stop the recording. And before that, put my cursor over here.

This is important.
