## 🛠️ `31 Pet Projects`
- I manage all my hobby coding projects and open-source experiments here.
- Each project starts as a simple note — and evolves as I build features, gather feedback, or pivot the idea.
- You can track:
    - Idea brainstorms
    - Technical notes
    - Version updates or changelogs
    - Learnings and takeaways

> ✨ Don’t worry about structure too much — projects evolve organically.
