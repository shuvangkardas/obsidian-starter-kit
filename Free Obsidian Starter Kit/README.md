This is a Johnny Decimal–based organization. I adopted it because it removes all the guesswork, every note or file gets a clear, permanent address. That means no clutter, no second-guessing, and even years from now I’ll know exactly where to put something and where to find it.

- **00 Home** → Everything personal and foundational: health, family, legal, finance, travel, assets, and journaling.
- **10 Learning and Teaching** → Anything related to studying, courses, skills I’m learning, or teaching materials I create.
