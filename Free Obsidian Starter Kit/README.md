It took me 3.5 years, 6,000+ notes, and a full PhD to build what you’re about to start with. After guiding 1,000+ students through YouTube, I created the **Obsidian Starter Kit** — the exact system I wish I had from day one!

Capture your thoughts, connect your ideas, and finally sleep better knowing everything is in one place.

 
If you want to phrase it as a complete set, it might look like:
1. **Capture system** – to frictionless collect ideas and learning.
2. **Knowledge system** – to build connected notes from literature and experience.
3. **Task system** – to track and execute daily and weekly actions.
4. **Project & goal system** – to manage medium- and long-term priorities.
5. **Life system** – to organize health, travel, family, job, and hobbies.
6. **Review & reflection system** – to evaluate progress and redirect efforts.
7. **Distillation & sharing system** – to convert raw knowledge into outputs (papers, blogs, videos).

## Organization System 
This is a **Johnny Decimal**–based organization. I adopted it because it removes all the guesswork: every note or file gets a clear, permanent address. That means no clutter, no second-guessing, and even years from now I’ll know exactly where to put something and where to find it. Read more at [[Understand Starter Kit Organization Mechanism]].
