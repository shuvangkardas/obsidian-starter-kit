As you are aware at this point that I make YouTube video on this topic. Not only that, I also publish more blogs than YouTube video in wide range of topic. I also write facebook post, Reddit post, LinkedIn post etc. 


All of these “Show yourself” stuff I do inside “Content” folder. Everything inside “Content” folder, I consider it as public. Therefore, whatever you publish, put inside content folder. 

Folder are like wall. Content folder is a well between your other folders. If you you want to publish something, you need to fine tune it before publishing. Do not copy notes from other folder. Try to create a new note inside content folder and fine tune your other folder notes as publishableable inside this folder. This way you can keep track of what is going outside. 

For example, right now, I am making this “Obsidian Starter Kit documentation inside “Content” folder. 

Now, depending on your publication type, you could create sub folders according to your requirement. 

In my Content folder, I have Websites subfolder, under which I have 4 other subfolders for my blog, newsletter, professional portfolio website, creator homepage.
