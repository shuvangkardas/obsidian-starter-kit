## 📢 40 Content and Creativity – Share What You Know

This folder is your **public-facing creativity zone**.
If you're publishing anything - YouTube videos, blog posts, newsletters, LinkedIn articles - this is where it should live. Think of it as the **"show yourself to the world"** zone.

## ✍️ Why Use a Separate `Content` Folder?
Your thoughts evolve privately, but once you polish them for the world, they deserve a spotlight.
- I treat **everything inside `Content` as public** - these are the ideas I’m okay sharing with the world.
- This folder acts as a **bridge** between your private vault and your digital presence.
- Instead of copying, I **refactor existing notes** from other folders here to ensure consistency, clarity, and polish.

## 🧭 Publishing Tips
- Always create new notes **directly inside this folder** when preparing something to share.
- Link back to original notes using `[[Note Title]]` rather than copying.
- Use `#published`, `#draft`, or `#todo` tags to track content status.

> Example: This very `Obsidian Starter Kit` documentation was drafted here before sharing publicly.
