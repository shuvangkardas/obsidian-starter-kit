## **A ready-to-use Obsidian vault for beginners. No overwhelm, no setup fatigue.**

It took me 3.5 years, 6,000+ notes, and a full PhD to build what you’re about to start with.
After guiding 1000+ students through YouTube, I created the Obsidian Starter Kit — the exact system I wish I had from day one!

Capture your thoughts, connect your ideas, and finally sleep better knowing everything is in one place.
